### Background

Globally, [1.47 billion people are exposed to the risk of intense flooding](https://blogs.worldbank.org/climatechange/147-billion-people-face-flood-risk-worldwide-over-third-it-could-be-devastating); 89% of them live in low and middle-income countries. More than 1 in 3 are poor. 132 million live in extreme poverty. Evidence points to a [vicious circle of disaster loss and poverty](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41885-020-00060-5), but what if **better targeting of earlier assistance** could help break it?

### Our experience in Bangladesh

In 2020, the United Nations piloted *anticipatory* cash transfers to vulnerable households in response to severe monsoon flooding affecting millions in Bangladesh . These cash transfers were activated when a 5-day forecast of river discharge exceeded a pre-determined dangerous threshold. Regions were targeted based on a rapid assessment of flood risk and socioeconomic vulnerability, and eligible households were drawn from pre-existing beneficiary lists due to COVID-19 restrictions. Cash transfers worth $53 were sent to 23,434 households using mobile money before peak flooding.
